We have a tool which help us to provision infrastructure automatically in Google cloud and it is also a Google cloud managed tool. We also called as infrastructure as a cloud in Google cloud which is a Google cloud native service.

Service we used as a Infrastructure as a cloud inside Google cloud is Deployment Manager.

Deployment manager is the Google cloud offering from Google cloud which will help us to provision infrastructure automaically in Google Cloud.

We need to be familiar with Python and Jinja templates to use Deployment manager.
But only limitation with deployment manager is, Deployment manager only can provison and destroy resources with in Google Cloud. It will not help us to provision resource in any other cloud like AWS or Azure. You cannot do. It's like a vendor locking service offering from Google Cloud.

Even we have similar products available in AWS and Azure.
Azure Resource Manager is there in Azure.
Cloud Formation is there in AWS.
These are the tools which will help with in the cloud.

It's a tool which help organizations to handle resources in different environments.

Benefits of tool?
When we are leaning Associate cloud engineer training, most of the time when you perform hands on labs, you will be heavily using console to provision the resources. For example, if you want to create a virtual machine, you will go to console and you will provide parameters and then you will create a virtual machine. Similary if you want to deploy a application, again you need to go to Console. If you want to create a Bucket, you will go to the Console. There is a dependency. Most of the tasks will be perform by console or CLI which is Cloud shell or Cloud SDK.

But in realtime, you will be having so many environments. You have test environment, Staging environment, Production environment. We have to perform these activities in different environments.

At a scale you will be able to provision those environments. It will be very difficult when you do these confessions through console different environments, difinitely we might miss some setup that might cause issues in the environment and not all the environment will look like same. And another thing is it is very difficult to see who has done what changes and why they have done the changes. There is no revision or version history maintained for these kind of changes when you do manually. There should be some better goverance mechanism so that you know even the infrastructure provision can be automated so that
